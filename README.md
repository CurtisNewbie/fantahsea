# fantahsea

Fantahsea is a simple gallery/image hosting backend service. It's built using GO, GIN, GORM and other beautiful libraries. It's a simple, personal project, so it won't be very useful for you :D

### Requirements

- [goauth](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/goauth)
- [vfm](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/vfm)
- [mini-fstore](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/mini-fstore)
- [hammer](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/hammer)
- Consul
- MySQL
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

### About Thumbnails Generation

Thumbnail is generated by [hammer](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/hammer).

### Configurations

See [gocommon](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/gocommon) and [miso](https://github.com/curtisnewbie/miso) for more information.

### Changes

- Since v1.0.3.5, `fantahsea` nolonger serves the original images. The original images before compression are served by `file-service`. `Fantahsea` only serves the generated thumbnails.
- Since v1.0.6, files are served by `mini-fstore` rather than `file-service`. `file-service` is replaced by `vfm`.
- Since v1.0.7, `fantahsea` nolonger compresses the image and serves the thumbnail. The thumbnail is generated by `hammer` and served by `mini-fstore`.
