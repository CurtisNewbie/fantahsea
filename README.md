# fantahsea

Fantahsea is a simple gallery/image hosting backend service. It's built using GO, GIN, GORM and other beautiful libraries. It's a simple, personal project, so it won't be very useful for you :D

### Requirements

- [goauth >= v1.0.0](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/goauth)
- [vfm >= v0.0.3](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/vfm)
- [mini-fstore >= v0.0.1](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/mini-fstore)
- [hammer >= v0.0.1](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/hammer)
- Consul
- MySQL
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

### About Thumbnails Generation

Thumbnail was generated using linux's `convert` program

```sh
# 256x means 256 pixels
convert original.png -resize 256x original-thumbnail.png
```

Now, it's completely handled by [`hammer`](https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/hammer), it doesn't really depend on `hammer` service tho.

### Configurations

See https://github.com/CurtisNewbie/gocommon for more information.

### Changes

- Since v1.0.3.5, `fantahsea` nolonger serves the original images. The original images before compression are served by `file-service`. `Fantahsea` only serves the generated thumbnails.
- Since v1.0.6, files are served by `mini-fstore` rather than `file-service`. `file-service` is replaced by `vfm`.
- Since v1.0.7, `fantahsea` nolonger compresses the image and serves the thumbnail. The thumbnail is generated by `hammer` and served by `mini-fstore`.
